# Visualization of Kraken Crypto Exchange Orderbooks in 3 Dimensions

This repository holds all the necessary components to visualize an orderbook from Kraken Crypto Exchange in 3 dimensions. Historically, L2 Orderbooks have been used to display the bid ask spread as a function of price and time. Here we have developed our own orderbook to hold Kraken Data, Feedhandlers to pull from the public API, and a React App using the three.js library to visualize an order book for any currency in the Kraken Exchange as a function of price, time and a third component, depth. 

### Components:
- Backend
    - Typescript
    - KrakenAPI
    - Websocket
- Frontend
    - HTML/CSS
    - React
    - three.js

## Goal
Our goal is to develop a 3D visualization of an order book to display financial instruments of an exchange with price, quantity, and depth. Using the Kraken Websocket API, Three js library, and our implementation of an Order Book, we were able to create a realtime 3D visualization. 

## Description
This is a semester long project for IE 421 - High Frequency Trading Technology instructed by Professor David Lariviere.

## Installations
```sh
cd my-react-app
npm install
npm start
```

## Features
- Shows Kraken Crypto Exchange bid ask spread in real time. 
- Orderbook animations to show the bid ask spread as a function of price, quantity, and depth. 
- Dropdown menu to filter data based on currency symbols, such as 'ETH/USDT' 

## Potential future ideas

- We would like to add more exchanges done via adding new feedhandlers and creating a dropdown option for exchanges. 
- Add frontend functionality to visualize exchanges around the world, showing trades executing from different locations.
- Add historical menu to see visualizations for past market data, such as the flash crash. 
- Edit animation to center the market in our camera. 
- Add trade indicators or have a status bar for trades occuring
- Optimize orderbook and animations to run smoother for the client.
