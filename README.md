## Running the Website Locally
** Getting Started with Create React App **

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

** Available Scripts **

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Goal
Our goal is to help visualize orderbooks of different exchanges as a function of time. 

## Description
This is a semester long project for IE 421 - High Frequency Trading Technology instructed by Professor David Lariviere.

## Visuals

Insert screenshots here.

## Features
- Shows Kraken Crypto Exchange bid ask spread in real time. 
- Orderbook animations to show the bid ask spread as a function of price, quantity, and depth. 
- Dropdown menu to filter data based on currency symbols, such as 'ETH/USDT' 

## Potential future ideas

- We would like to add more exchanges done via adding new feedhandlers and creating a dropdown option for exchanges. 
- Add frontend functionality to visualize exchanges around the world, showing trades executing from different locations.
- Add historical menu to see visualizations for past market data, such as the flash crash. 
- Edit animation to center the market in our camera.
