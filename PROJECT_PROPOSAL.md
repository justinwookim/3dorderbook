# group_03_project_proposal 

## Overview

This project aims to develop a 3D visualization of an order book, commonly known as the Depth of Book, by leveraging various web technologies and APIs. The technical stack includes Vue.js for frontend development, ensuring a reactive and dynamic user interface, TailwindCSS for sleek and responsive styling, and Three.js for enabling 3D rendering capabilities. The project will also involve using built-in JavaScript functionalities to handle API requests, retrieving financial data from specified firms to populate the order book.

## Problem Statement

The primary question this project aims to solve is, "How can the depth of market orders be visualized interactively and three-dimensionally to offer users enhanced insights and understanding of market conditions?" Traditional order books provide a two-dimensional view, often limiting the clarity and depth of market insights.

## Tech Stack

* Technologies, libraries, frameworks, languages, etc
    + Tailwind, Vue, three.js, Typescript and javascript, Exchange APIs: Bitmex, IEX Cloud, Coinbase, etc. API handling: Built-in JavaScript 
* Hardware 
    + This is a web page, so we donâ€™t need any specific hardware and can run things locally. 
* Frameworks, libraries, etc, for CI/CD
    + N/A
* GUI Mockup
    + Something similar to this link
