# group_03_project_proposal 

## Overview

This project aims to develop a 3D visualization of an order book, commonly known as the Depth of Book, by leveraging various web technologies and APIs. The technical stack includes Vue.js for frontend development, ensuring a reactive and dynamic user interface, TailwindCSS for sleek and responsive styling, and Three.js for enabling 3D rendering capabilities. The project will also involve using built-in JavaScript functionalities to handle API requests, retrieving financial data from specified firms to populate the order book.

## Problem Statement

The primary question this project aims to solve is, "How can the depth of market orders be visualized interactively and three-dimensionally to offer users enhanced insights and understanding of market conditions?" Traditional order books provide a two-dimensional view, often limiting the clarity and depth of market insights. We provide a solution to this question by providing another dimensionality to the view, in order to offer users a different medium to visualize market data in an interactive way. 

## Tech Stack

* Technologies, libraries, frameworks, languages, etc
    + Tailwind, Vue, three.js, Typescript and javascript, Exchange APIs: Bitmex, IEX Cloud, Coinbase, etc. API handling: Built-in JavaScript 
* Hardware 
    + This is a web page, so we don’t need any specific hardware and can run things locally. 
* Frameworks, libraries, etc, for CI/CD
    + N/A
* GUI Mockup
    + Something similar to this link

## Goals
* Bare Minimum Goals
    + Create a functional order book that can handle the basic tasks such as buying, selling, and when a trade occurs 
    + Provide a Layer 3 Order book that can visualize the depth chart of an exchange. 
* Expected Goals
    + Enhanced Visualization: To transform the conventional 2D order book into a more insightful 3D visualization, allowing users to interact and analyze market depths with improved clarity and comprehension.
    + Real-Time Data Representation: By integrating with financial data APIs, the project aims to offer a real-time representation of market orders, ensuring the relevance and accuracy of the displayed data.
    + User Interaction: Developing an interface that not only presents data but also allows users to interact, manipulate views, and customize their analysis, promoting a more engaging user experience.
* Stretch Goals
    + Add Historic Event Functionality
    + Add VR capability using WebGL and three.js to create a virtual environment where you can look at multiple exchanges.

## Workflow
* Planning and Design
    + Define the user interface layout.
    + Plan necessary functionalities and features.
* Development
    + Code functionalities.
    + Integrate various technologies.
* Testing and Debugging
    + Test features for bugs.
    + Debug and optimize.
* Optimization
    + Refine user interface.
    + Optimize performance.
* Documentation  and Optimization
    + Document the codebase.
    + Prepare for submission/presentation.

## Meetings and Communications: 
* Regular Check-ins
    + Conduct meetings twice a week.
* Communication
    + Maintain active communication within the team through discord.

## Teammates
* While we will be working collaboratively to fulfill project deliverables, Joe and Kenny will prioritize developing, designing and testing for the Order book itself, while Justin and Ritul will focus more on the frontend testing and development. However, each member will be working together for all aspects of the project.

* Kenny Kim: Graduating Spring 2025, May apply to Masters/PhD.
* Justin Kim: Graduating Spring 2024, interested in MCS at UIUC
* Joe Morrissey: Graduating Spring 2025
* Ritul Soni: Graduating Spring 2024, Applying for MCS
