// 1. The `SceneManager` class is designed to manage the `Scene` object from Three.js.
// 2. The `addElement` and `removeElement` methods are straightforward: they add or remove elements (like meshes, lights, etc.) from the scene.
// 3. The `disposeElement` method is an example of how you might handle resource cleanup. This is important for WebGL applications to avoid memory leaks, especially when you frequently add and remove elements.

// You might need to expand this class with additional methods depending on the specific requirements of your application. For instance, if you have specific routines for updating or resetting the scene, those could be added as methods to this class.

// When integrating `SceneManager` into your application, you'll create an instance of it and use its methods to manage all scene-related operations, making the main code cleaner and more manageable.
